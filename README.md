# Stationeers SICC Template

A template for [Stationeers SICC Compiler](https://github.com/Alan-Chen99/sicc).

Currently this repo locks a version of SICC slightly more tested than a typical commit.
In the future it will probably pull from PyPI instead. Use `uv lock --upgrade` to upgrade.

Please write an issue if this template doesnt work or can include config for whatever tooling you use.
